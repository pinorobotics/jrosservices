/**
 * Service definition.
 *
 * <p>In ROS, messages which are used to communicate with ROS Services are defined in srv/*.srv
 * files. For each service it needs to have 2 messages: Request, Response.
 *
 * <p>This interface acts similar to *.srv files. Users describe messages for communicating with
 * each ROS Service by implementing it. Later {@link JRosServiceClient} is using these definitions
 * to send a requests to ROS Services and receive results from them.
 *
 * <p>Since there are many message types involved it is easy to accidently mix-up message types from
 * different ROS Services. This interface helps to address this too. It consolidates all message
 * types for each ROS Service and helps to detect any type issues during compile time.
 *
 * @param <R> request message type
 * @param <A> response message type
